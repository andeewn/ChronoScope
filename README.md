# Financial & Time Management Toolkit

This project is a collection of useful calculators to help manage your finances and time effectively. It includes tools for tracking expenses, planning savings, understanding the true cost of purchases, managing free time, and evaluating vacation home affordability.

## Features

This toolkit includes the following calculators:

*   **Expenses Projection Calculator:** Input your various recurring expenses (e.g., rent, subscriptions, utilities) with their costs and how often they occur (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, etc.). The calculator then projects your total expenses over a specified number of years, displaying a yearly breakdown and a chart of cumulative expenses. This helps in understanding long-term financial commitments.
*   **Freetime Calculator:** Analyze how you spend your time on a weekly basis. Input hours spent on sleep, work/school (including number of work/school days), personal care, chores, and add custom activities with their duration and occurrence (daily, weekdays, weekends). The calculator displays your average daily committed time, average daily freetime, and total weekly freetime. It also visualizes your time allocation with pie charts for an average day, a typical work/school day, and a typical weekend day.
*   **Savings Goal Calculator:** Plan your savings by inputting your initial savings, regular monthly contribution, current age (optional), expected annual interest rate, and the number of years you plan to save. The calculator projects the growth of your savings, showing a year-by-year breakdown of contributions, interest earned, and ending balance. A line chart visualizes your savings growth over time, comparing it with a scenario of 0% interest.
*   **True Cost Calculator:** Understand the real cost of an item beyond its sticker price. Input the item's price, any down payment, loan details (interest rate, term in years if financing), and a potential investment interest rate. The calculator compares three scenarios: the direct purchase price, the total cost if financed (including loan interest), and the potential future value if the item's price was invested instead (opportunity cost). These are displayed in a bar chart.
*   **Vacation Home Affordability Calculator:** A detailed tool to analyze the financial implications of purchasing a vacation home. Input details like purchase price, down payment, loan terms, expected rental income (weekly rate, number of rental weeks), operating costs, insurance, maintenance, property fees, and an analysis period. The calculator provides a breakdown of initial costs, annual operational results (factoring in rental income and taxes), a break-even analysis, and a year-by-year projection of property value, remaining loan balance, and cumulative financial outcome. Results are also visualized in a line chart.

## Technical Stack

*   **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** Used for structuring the web pages and the calculator interfaces.
*   **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Used for styling the visual presentation of the application.
*   **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** Powers all the calculator logic, user interactions, and dynamic content updates.
*   **Chart.js:** A JavaScript library used to create interactive charts for visualizing calculator results.
*   **Browser LocalStorage:** Utilized to save user inputs locally in their web browser, allowing data to persist between sessions for each calculator.
